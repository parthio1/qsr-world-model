        "reasoning": "Given the 'customer_first' priority and the combination of a Friday night, a local rock concert, and stormy weather, I am allocating a robust team of 14. The storm will likely push more customers to the double drive-thru lanes, requiring 5 staff to maintain speed. The kitchen needs 6 to handle the high volume of orders from both channels. Despite the weather, the downtown concert will drive front counter traffic, so 3 staff are assigned there to ensure quick turnaround. This minimizes wait times and maximizes customer satisfaction during a high-pressure shift."

        "reasoning": "Given the priority to minimize cost, I am operating with a skeleton crew. Saturday lunch in a downtown location typically sees high volume, but by limiting the front counter to one person and the kitchen to four, we reduce the hourly burn rate significantly. The drive-thru is staffed with three people to manage the two lanes, which is the primary bottleneck, but still lean. The risk of high wait times is acknowledged as a trade-off for lower labor expenses. I am banking on the kitchen's medium capacity to handle the load without extra hands."

With 2 drive-thru lanes, 3 staff members are necessary to manage order taking and window service efficiently. The kitchen requires 4 people to handle the complexity of breakfast assembly and prep. I've allocated 2 staff to the front counter to ensure walk-in customers are served quickly without creating a bottleneck, as downtown foot traffic can be significant during the morning rush. This uses 9 out of 10 available staff, providing a safety margin while keeping labor costs under control."
