        "reasoning": "### 1. Priority Analysis: Customer First\nUnder the 'customer_first' priority, the primary objective is to minimize wait times (SOS) and maximize order accuracy. Labor cost is a secondary concern compared to the potential loss of brand loyalty or negative reviews during a high-profile event like a downtown concert.\n\n### 2. Operational Scenario & Bottleneck Identification\n- **Demand Drivers:** Friday dinner + Rock Concert = Extreme volume. \n- **Weather Impact:** Stormy conditions typically drive customers away from the front counter and toward the drive-thru. However, in a 'Downtown' setting, the front counter often sees a surge of pedestrians seeking shelter and a quick meal before the event.\n- **Bottleneck:** The 'Medium' capacity kitchen is the primary bottleneck. If the kitchen cannot produce food fast enough to feed both the 2-lane drive-thru and the 50-seat dine-in area, the customer experience will collapse regardless of how many people are at the registers.\n\n### 3. Trade-offs & Allocation Strategy\n- **Kitchen (7 staff):** Allocated the maximum effective capacity. This allows for dedicated roles: 2 on assembly, 1 on grill, 1 on fry, 1 on prep/backup, and 2 on bagging/expediting for both channels. This mitigates the risk of order backlogs.\n- **Drive-Thru (5 staff):** With 2 lanes and stormy weather, the DT will be the preferred channel. 5 staff allow for 2 dedicated order takers, 1 payment window operator, 1 presenter, and 1 runner to assist with high-volume bagging.\n- **Front Counter (3 staff):** Despite the storm, the concert ensures foot traffic. 3 staff allow for 2 active registers and 1 lobby attendant to ensure the dine-in area remains clean and orders are expedited to the tables quickly.\n\n### 4. Risk Analysis\n- **Service Risk:** Very Low. The high staffing level ensures that even if one channel is slammed, there is enough 'flex' staff to maintain speed.\n- **Financial Risk:** High. If the storm is severe enough to cancel the concert or keep everyone home, the restaurant will be significantly overstaffed, leading to a high labor-to-sales ratio. However, this risk is accepted to satisfy the 'Customer First' priority.\n\n### 5. Labor Cost Calculation\n- Total Staff: 15\n- Shift Duration: 8 hours\n- Total Hours: 120 (15 * 8)\n- Estimated Cost: 120 hours * $15.00/hr (standardized rate) = $1,800.00."

        "rationale": "This plan utilizes the full available staff pool to manage the high-velocity breakfast demand typical of a Downtown Atlanta location. By prioritizing kitchen throughput and adding support to the drive-thru and front counter, we balance speed of service with staff wellbeing.",
        "reasoning": "UNDERSTAND OPERATOR PRIORITY: The priority is 'balanced,' which requires a middle-ground approach that doesn't sacrifice customer experience for profit, nor overspend to the point of inefficiency. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Tuesday breakfast in Downtown Atlanta is a high-volume period driven by commuters and office workers. Sunny weather suggests high foot traffic and full drive-thru lanes. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck; if breakfast sandwiches and coffee orders aren't produced rapidly, both the 2-lane drive-thru and the front counter will experience significant backups. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We are allocating 5 staff to the kitchen (2 above minimum) to ensure the 'engine' of the restaurant keeps up with the dual-channel demand. We allocate 3 to the drive-thru to manage the two lanes (one for window, two for order-taking/staging) and 2 to the front counter to handle the 'grab-and-go' office crowd. This prevents staff burnout during the 8-hour shift while keeping wait times low. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is a slightly higher labor cost if the morning rush ends earlier than expected, but this is mitigated by the high revenue potential of a fully-staffed downtown peak shift. There is a very low risk of customer dissatisfaction."
