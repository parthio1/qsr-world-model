        "reasoning": "UNDERSTAND OPERATOR PRIORITY: The priority is 'customer_first', which necessitates prioritizing speed of service and order accuracy over labor cost optimization. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Friday dinner shift in Downtown Atlanta with a rock concert suggests high volume. However, the 'stormy' weather will likely pivot the service mix heavily toward Drive-Thru and delivery, as customers avoid walking in the rain. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The Kitchen is the primary bottleneck; with 'medium' capacity, it must be fully staffed to prevent a backlog that affects both channels. The Drive-Thru is the secondary bottleneck due to the weather-induced surge and the 2-lane configuration. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 15 staff (the maximum) to ensure that even with high complexity and weather delays, the customer experience remains seamless. I moved staff from the front counter (keeping it at 3 to handle mobile orders and concert-goers) to the Kitchen and Drive-Thru to mitigate the stress of the storm-driven rush. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is financial—if the storm is severe enough to cancel the concert or keep everyone home, the restaurant will be significantly overstaffed. However, per the 'customer_first' priority, the risk of a poor experience during a potential rush outweighs the risk of high labor costs. STAFF ALLOCATION: 7 Kitchen (maximum production), 5 Drive-Thru (handling 2 lanes plus bagging), 3 Front Counter (handling dine-in and the inevitable surge of delivery drivers). ESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at 15 staff * 8 hours * $15.00/hr average wage = $1,800.00."

By prioritizing the kitchen with 5 staff members, we ensure that the 'engine' of the restaurant can keep up with both drive-thru and walk-in demand, maintaining a balance between speed of service and staff wellbeing.",
        "reasoning": "UNDERSTAND OPERATOR PRIORITY: The 'balanced' priority requires a middle-ground approach that protects profit margins without sacrificing the customer experience or overworking the team. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Tuesday breakfast in Downtown Atlanta suggests a high volume of commuters (Drive-Thru) and office workers (Front Counter). Sunny weather typically increases foot traffic. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck; if food production lags, both service channels fail. With a 'medium' capacity kitchen, 5 staff members allow for dedicated roles (prep, assembly, toast/eggs, and coordination). REASON TRADE-OFFS: We allocated 3 staff to the Drive-Thru (Order/Pay/Present) to manage the 2 lanes efficiently, and 2 to the Front Counter to handle dine-in and walk-ins. While 10 staff members hits the maximum budget, it prevents the 'hidden costs' of long wait times (lost future revenue) and staff burnout. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is a higher labor-to-sales ratio if the morning rush is shorter than expected; however, the risk of customer dissatisfaction due to slow service in a time-sensitive breakfast window is much higher if we staff lower."
