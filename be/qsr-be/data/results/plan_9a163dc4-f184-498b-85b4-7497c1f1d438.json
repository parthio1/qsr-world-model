While staffing cannot change the physical infrastructure cap, it can ensure the restaurant operates at 100% of that cap. I have reallocated the budget to use all 20 available staff (80 budget hours). Kitchen staff is increased from 7 to 10 to eliminate prep-related delays. Front Counter is increased to 5 to handle the 72 orders/hour combined dine-in and delivery demand, ensuring that the 'time-to-order' is minimized. Drive-thru is set at 5 to match the 2-lane capacity and 48 orders/hour demand. This 'saturation' approach is designed to reduce the controllable friction in the order-to-delivery pipeline, aiming to bring wait times closer to the 400s threshold."
