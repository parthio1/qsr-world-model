BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, with a maximum capacity of 80 orders/hour against a potential demand of 110 orders/hour. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (the highest possible within this budget) to ensure we reach the 80 orders/hr ceiling. I moved 1 extra staff member to the Front Counter (total 2) to manage the pre-concert dine-in rush, and 1 extra to the Drive-Thru (total 3) to manage the dual lanes. We are sacrificing the ability to serve the 'excess' 30 orders/hour potential because the kitchen cannot physically produce them; adding more front-end staff would only increase the order queue without increasing output. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'Medium' because the kitchen will be operating at 100% capacity for the duration of the pre-concert window. This poses a risk of staff burnout and increased ticket times, but under-staffing the kitchen further would lead to a 'High' risk of customer abandonment and extreme staff stress.

With a hard budget cap of 80 hours (10 staff), we must allocate resources where they have the highest impact on flow. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: The concert event on Peachtree St creates a high dine-in preference (1.35 multiplier). The previous attempt failed because 2 front counter staff could not handle the lobby surge, and 5 kitchen staff hit a production ceiling. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The primary bottleneck is the 'Medium' kitchen capacity (80-112 orders/hr) vs. a peak demand of 138/hr. The secondary bottleneck is the Front Counter intake during the pre-concert window. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We maintain 5 staff in the kitchen to reach the maximum possible throughput (112 orders/hr). We increase Front Counter staffing to 3 (up from 2) to mitigate the 'lobby congestion' and 'frustrating wait times' reported previously. To stay within the 10-person budget, Drive-Thru is kept at the minimum requirement of 2, as the concert surge favors walk-in traffic over vehicle traffic. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk remains 'Medium' because the kitchen will still be operating at near 100% utilization during peak hours, which may still lead to some order accuracy issues or slight delays, but the increased front-of-house presence will reduce abandonment by managing the queue more effectively."

Over the 4-hour shift, the restaurant is physically unable to meet the total demand of 552 orders, resulting in a maximum of 440 served. Wait times were modeled to cap at 600 seconds (10 minutes) due to the abandonment constraint; customers exceeding this threshold are assumed to leave the queue.

            "reasoning": "UNDERSTAND OPERATOR PRIORITY: The 'Balanced' priority requires a compromise between maximizing the revenue opportunity presented by the concert and maintaining staff wellbeing and customer service levels. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A 1.45x demand multiplier combined with a 1.35 dine-in preference (due to weather and the concert) creates a high-pressure environment. With a budget of 80 hours and an 8-hour shift, we are capped at 10 total staff members. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, with a maximum capacity of 80 orders/hour against a potential demand of 110 orders/hour. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (the highest possible within this budget) to ensure we reach the 80 orders/hr ceiling. I moved 1 extra staff member to the Front Counter (total 2) to manage the pre-concert dine-in rush, and 1 extra to the Drive-Thru (total 3) to manage the dual lanes. We are sacrificing the ability to serve the 'excess' 30 orders/hour potential because the kitchen cannot physically produce them; adding more front-end staff would only increase the order queue without increasing output. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'Medium' because the kitchen will be operating at 100% capacity for the duration of the pre-concert window. This poses a risk of staff burnout and increased ticket times, but under-staffing the kitchen further would lead to a 'High' risk of customer abandonment and extreme staff stress. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15/hr (estimated standard rate) = $1,200."

Capacity calculations show the kitchen (5 staff) can handle 112.5 orders/hr, and the drive-thru (3 staff) can handle 90 cars/hr. Because peak demand (138) exceeded kitchen capacity (112.5), a queue formed rapidly between 5:45 PM and 7:30 PM. Using the abandonment constraint, customers began leaving the queue once wait times hit the 10-minute (600s) mark. Revenue was calculated using a 60/40 split between drive-thru ($16 AOV) and walk-in ($20 AOV). High utilization (0.96) during the rush period resulted in a slight degradation of order accuracy (0.89) due to staff fatigue and speed-over-precision trade-offs."

With a hard budget cap of 80 hours (10 staff), we must allocate resources where they have the highest impact on flow. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: The concert event on Peachtree St creates a high dine-in preference (1.35 multiplier). The previous attempt failed because 2 front counter staff could not handle the lobby surge, and 5 kitchen staff hit a production ceiling. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The primary bottleneck is the 'Medium' kitchen capacity (80-112 orders/hr) vs. a peak demand of 138/hr. The secondary bottleneck is the Front Counter intake during the pre-concert window. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We maintain 5 staff in the kitchen to reach the maximum possible throughput (112 orders/hr). We increase Front Counter staffing to 3 (up from 2) to mitigate the 'lobby congestion' and 'frustrating wait times' reported previously. To stay within the 10-person budget, Drive-Thru is kept at the minimum requirement of 2, as the concert surge favors walk-in traffic over vehicle traffic. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk remains 'Medium' because the kitchen will still be operating at near 100% utilization during peak hours, which may still lead to some order accuracy issues or slight delays, but the increased front-of-house presence will reduce abandonment by managing the queue more effectively."
