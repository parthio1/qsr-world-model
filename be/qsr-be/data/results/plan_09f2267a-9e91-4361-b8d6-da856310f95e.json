Front counter staffing is increased to 2 to handle the sunny Sunday dine-in preference (1.15 multiplier) and maintain the 50-seat dining area. Three staff members manage the dual drive-thru lanes, providing enough support for order taking and expediting without exceeding the kitchen's ability to fulfill orders. The 'medium' risk reflects that even with optimal staffing, the physical kitchen capacity may still lead to slight wait times during the absolute peak of the lunch rush."
