ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday dinner is usually quiet, but the concert and sunny weather create a high-demand spike. With a demand multiplier of 1.25 and a preference for dine-in (1.2), we expect the 50-seat dining room to be at capacity. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the critical bottleneck. It has a maximum capacity of 80 orders/hr, while potential demand is estimated at 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 50% of the total shift headcount (5 staff) to the kitchen to ensure it operates at its maximum 'medium' capacity. The front counter is increased to 2 staff to handle the influx of concert-goers and dine-in guests. The drive-thru is staffed with 3 people to manage the two lanes and the window efficiently. We are trading off higher labor costs (using the full budget) to ensure we don't lose revenue during the pre-concert window. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'medium' because even with optimal staffing, the kitchen's physical capacity (80 orders/hr) is lower than the projected peak demand (110 orders/hr). Customers may still experience wait times during the peak hour before the concert starts. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at 80 total hours (10 staff * 8 hours) multiplied by an estimated average QSR wage of $15/hr."

Capacity Analysis: 5 kitchen staff provide a max throughput of 112.5 orders/hr (5 * 22.5). 3. Queue Dynamics: Because demand (140) > capacity (112.5), a backlog formed immediately at 6:15 PM. Wait times peaked at 11.3 minutes, leading to calculated abandonment (balking) which capped the 'customers served' metric. 4. Financials: Revenue was weighted toward walk-ins (60%) due to the concert/urban setting, using a $20 AOV for walk-ins and $16 for DT. Labor was fixed at $600 (10 staff * 4 hrs * $15). 5. Utilization: The kitchen was the primary bottleneck, operating at near 100% for 2.5 hours of the shift, which mathematically correlates to the slight dip in order accuracy (0.91)."

However, this efficiency is 'false' as it was achieved by under-staffing relative to actual demand. 2. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: The average wait time of 415s falls into the 'Unacceptable' category (>400s). The simulation shows that while 448 customers were served, the 12% abandonment rate represents significant lost revenue and brand damage, resulting in a raw score of 0.15. 3. STAFF WELLBEING: A utilization rate of 0.97 is unsustainable and leads to the observed dip in order accuracy. This falls into the 'High Risk' benchmark, earning a raw score of 0.25. 4. MATHEMATICAL SYNTHESIS: Using the Weighted Geometric Mean, the high Profit score (0.98^0.4 = 0.99) is heavily penalized by the failures in Customer Satisfaction (0.15^0.35 = 0.51) and Staff Wellbeing (0.25^0.25 = 0.71). The resulting combined score of 0.36 reflects a 'Poor' ranking because the plan maximized profit at the direct expense of operational viability and customer retention."

Specifically, the 1.2x dine-in preference suggests the 50-seat capacity will be tested. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary failure point. Previous data showed 5 staff members could not keep up with 140+ demand, leading to 415s wait times and 12% abandonment. The physical kitchen capacity is 80 orders/hr, but human error and bagging delays at high utilization (97%) are the immediate addressable issues. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am allocating 60% of the total staff (6 out of 10) to the kitchen. This allows for a dedicated expeditor/bagger to solve the 0.91 accuracy issue and speeds up the 'make-time' to lower wait times. To stay within the 80-hour budget (10 staff * 8 hours), I am keeping Drive-Thru at the minimum of 2. While 2 lanes are present, the kitchen's 80 orders/hr ceiling means that over-staffing the front-end would only create a larger backlog at the kitchen window. 2 staff at the Front Counter are essential to manage the pre-concert dine-in crowd and maintain lobby cleanliness. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is a 'medium' level of Drive-Thru congestion. With 2 lanes and only 2 staff, the queue may grow during the pre-concert peak.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: The average wait time of 315s falls into the 'Frustrating' category (300s-400s).

ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday dinner is usually quiet, but the concert and sunny weather create a high-demand spike. With a demand multiplier of 1.25 and a preference for dine-in (1.2), we expect the 50-seat dining room to be at capacity. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the critical bottleneck. It has a maximum capacity of 80 orders/hr, while potential demand is estimated at 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 50% of the total shift headcount (5 staff) to the kitchen to ensure it operates at its maximum 'medium' capacity. The front counter is increased to 2 staff to handle the influx of concert-goers and dine-in guests. The drive-thru is staffed with 3 people to manage the two lanes and the window efficiently. We are trading off higher labor costs (using the full budget) to ensure we don't lose revenue during the pre-concert window. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'medium' because even with optimal staffing, the kitchen's physical capacity (80 orders/hr) is lower than the projected peak demand (110 orders/hr). Customers may still experience wait times during the peak hour before the concert starts. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-thru, 2 Front Counter.

ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday dinner usually has lower baseline demand, but the 1.25x concert multiplier and sunny weather create a high-volume environment. Specifically, the 1.2x dine-in preference suggests the 50-seat capacity will be tested. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary failure point. Previous data showed 5 staff members could not keep up with 140+ demand, leading to 415s wait times and 12% abandonment. The physical kitchen capacity is 80 orders/hr, but human error and bagging delays at high utilization (97%) are the immediate addressable issues. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am allocating 60% of the total staff (6 out of 10) to the kitchen. This allows for a dedicated expeditor/bagger to solve the 0.91 accuracy issue and speeds up the 'make-time' to lower wait times. To stay within the 80-hour budget (10 staff * 8 hours), I am keeping Drive-Thru at the minimum of 2. While 2 lanes are present, the kitchen's 80 orders/hr ceiling means that over-staffing the front-end would only create a larger backlog at the kitchen window. 2 staff at the Front Counter are essential to manage the pre-concert dine-in crowd and maintain lobby cleanliness. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is a 'medium' level of Drive-Thru congestion. With 2 lanes and only 2 staff, the queue may grow during the pre-concert peak. However, this is preferable to the 'high' risk of kitchen burnout and order errors that occur when the kitchen is understaffed. STAFF ALLOCATION: 6 Kitchen, 2 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter.
