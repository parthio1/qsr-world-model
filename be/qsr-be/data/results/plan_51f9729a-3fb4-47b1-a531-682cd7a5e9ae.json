Increasing Drive-Thru to 5 and Front Counter to 4 ensures that order entry and food delivery keep pace with the kitchen's output, reducing the idle time and wait-time penalties identified in the feedback.

The 300-second deviation in wait time results in a 0.0 score, and the 0.24 deviation in utilization\u2014caused by the kitchen's inability to process orders fast enough to keep even a lean staff busy\u2014also results in a 0.0 score.

Issues: Labor cost percentage is double the target (60.54% vs 30%), Average wait time exceeds target by 105 seconds, Low staff utilization (0.62) indicates over-staffing relative to physical throughput limits, High customer abandonment rate (12%) due to physical drive-thru stacking limits. Address these issues to improve alignment with objectives."
