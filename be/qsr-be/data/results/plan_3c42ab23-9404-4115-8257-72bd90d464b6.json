ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: With a 145 orders/hr peak demand and a 10-person limit (80 budget hours / 8-hour shift), the allocation must be precise. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: Previous feedback confirmed the kitchen (at 5 staff) was the primary bottleneck, causing 12 abandonments and 345s wait times. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have moved 2 staff members from the front-of-house/drive-thru support into the kitchen. While this leaves the Front Counter and Drive-Thru at minimum levels (1 and 2 respectively), it ensures the kitchen can actually produce the orders taken. It is better to have a slight delay in taking an order than a massive backlog in the kitchen which leads to abandonment. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'intake' speed. With only 1 person at the front counter, a sudden surge of pedestrian traffic on Peachtree St could lead to a line. However, this is a lower risk than the 'very high' risk of kitchen burnout and customer abandonment seen previously. STAFF ALLOCATION: 7 Kitchen (Production), 2 Drive-Thru (Intake), 1 Front Counter (Intake). ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 80 total hours * $15.00/hr = $1200.00."

While the kitchen (7 staff) has a massive capacity of ~157 orders/hr, they are 'starved' by the slow order-entry rate at the front. This results in 412 customers served out of 480 potential, with the remainder lost to abandonment due to wait times exceeding 10 minutes during the 12:00-1:30 PM peak. Revenue is calculated using a 55/45 split between DT ($16 avg) and Walk-in ($20 avg).

With dual drive-thru lanes and a 50-seat dine-in area, the intake potential is high (110 units/hr). \n\nBOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a hard cap of 80 orders/hr. If the front-of-house (DT + Front Counter) operates at full capacity, they will overwhelm the kitchen, leading to long ticket times and staff stress. \n\nREASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (50% of the total shift) to ensure production stays as close to the 80 orders/hr ceiling as possible. 3 staff are assigned to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes (one for order taking, one for payment/window, and one for bagging/running). 2 staff are assigned to the front counter to handle walk-in traffic and maintain the 50-seat lobby. This prevents any single station from being the 'weak link' while staying exactly at the 80-hour budget limit (10 staff * 8 hours). \n\nRISK ANALYSIS: The risk is low. The main risk is that if pedestrian traffic spikes significantly, the 2 front-counter staff may struggle to balance register duties with lobby maintenance. However, over-staffing the front would require taking from the kitchen, which would slow down the entire restaurant. \n\nESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at an industry average of $15.00/hr (80 total hours * $15 = $1,200.00)."

BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: Previous feedback confirmed the kitchen (at 5 staff) was the primary bottleneck, causing 12 abandonments and 345s wait times. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have moved 2 staff members from the front-of-house/drive-thru support into the kitchen. While this leaves the Front Counter and Drive-Thru at minimum levels (1 and 2 respectively), it ensures the kitchen can actually produce the orders taken. It is better to have a slight delay in taking an order than a massive backlog in the kitchen which leads to abandonment. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'intake' speed. With only 1 person at the front counter, a sudden surge of pedestrian traffic on Peachtree St could lead to a line. However, this is a lower risk than the 'very high' risk of kitchen burnout and customer abandonment seen previously.
