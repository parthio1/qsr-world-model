With a budget of 80 hours (10 staff for an 8-hour shift), we maximize the headcount to handle the 130+ order/hr peak. By increasing kitchen staff to 6, we raise the throughput capacity above the previous 112 orders/hr limit to mitigate the 580s wait times and reduce staff burnout. Drive-thru is reduced to the minimum of 2 staff to correct the previous 55% underutilization, while the Front Counter is increased to 2 to manage the high urban walk-in volume characteristic of the Peachtree St location. This creates a balanced utilization profile across all stations."

Weaknesses: Critical staff burnout risk with an average utilization of 0.92, exceeding the 0.90 threshold for high risk., Significant peak wait times (580s) led to observed customer abandonment (churn)., Internal resource imbalance: Drive-thru staff were underutilized (55%) while the kitchen and front counter were severely over-extended.. Please adjust staffing to address these specific issues."
