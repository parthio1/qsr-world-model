This uses all 45 budget hours assuming a 4.5-hour shift duration.

      "reasoning": "The plan achieves a perfect profit score (1.0) due to extremely low labor costs relative to revenue. However, this comes at the expense of customer satisfaction (0.1875) because wait times are nearly triple the benchmark. Staff wellbeing (0.48) is also low due to high utilization.

By increasing kitchen staff to 6, we maximize the throughput of the primary bottleneck. Reducing the front counter to 1 staff member acts as a tactical throttle; it slows the rate of dine-in order entry to approximately 20-30 orders/hr. This ensures that the drive-thru (supported by 3 staff for 2 lanes) can maintain its fulfillment speed without being overwhelmed by a surge of dine-in orders.

The kitchen remains at 6 staff to maintain its maximum throughput of 80 orders/hr, which is critical given the 120/hr peak demand. While the drive-thru is reduced to the minimum of 2 staff, this trade-off is necessary to capture high-margin walk-in revenue and reduce overall abandonment without exceeding the total staff constraint of 10."

While the 10-person staff is theoretically capable of higher throughput, the 'medium' kitchen capacity limits output to 80 orders/hour. Since peak demand reaches 120 orders/hour, the restaurant fails to serve approximately 55 potential customers who abandon the queue due to wait times exceeding 10 minutes. Revenue is calculated based on a 50/50 split between drive-thru ($16 AOV) and dine-in ($20 AOV). Staff utilization is high due to the constant backlog of orders from 11:45 AM through 1:45 PM."

However, the current staffing levels result in a 'poor' ranking due to unacceptable service speeds and staff exhaustion. To improve, the restaurant must either increase kitchen throughput capacity via equipment upgrades or implement demand-shaping strategies to smooth the peak, as the current 10-person team is being pushed to an unsustainable 94% utilization.",

However, the Customer Satisfaction score (0.28) and Staff Wellbeing score (0.24) are critically low because the volume of customers far exceeds the kitchen's output capacity, leading to 18-minute peak waits and near-constant maximum effort from the staff. The weighted arithmetic mean reflects that the financial gains do not justify the operational strain and brand damage from poor service."
