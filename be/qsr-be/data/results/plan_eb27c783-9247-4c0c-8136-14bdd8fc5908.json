            "recommendation": "Increase staffing in the kitchen and drive-thru to reduce wait times. Since labor cost is currently 2.7% under target, there is budget available to add 1-2 more staff members to improve service speed and bring utilization closer to the 0.82 target.",
            "reasoning": "The plan prioritizes labor efficiency over service quality. While it achieves a perfect profit score by keeping labor costs at 27.3%, the customer satisfaction score is 0.0 because the 65-second deviation in wait time exceeds the 60-second penalty threshold. Staff wellbeing is also compromised, as the 0.89 utilization rate indicates the team is stretched beyond the ideal 0.82 target during peak hours."

Bottlenecks found: Front counter capacity reached 95% utilization during the 12:30 PM peak, Drive-thru lane 1 experienced minor slowdowns due to high customization requests. Issues: Staff utilization of 0.76 is below the ideal target of 0.82, indicating slight overstaffing. Address these issues to improve alignment with objectives."
