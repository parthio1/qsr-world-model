      "strengths": [
        "Excellent labor-to-revenue ratio (11.7%) despite high headcount.",
        "High kitchen throughput prevented order preparation from becoming a bottleneck.",
        "Strong revenue capture ($9,184) during a complex double-event day (Holiday + Concert)."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Average wait time (345s) exceeded the 300s quality threshold.",
        "Diminishing returns on Drive-Thru staffing due to physical lane constraints.",
        "Front counter congestion during peak 12:30-1:30 PM window suggests localized understaffing."
      ],
      "recommendation": "Reallocate 1 staff member from the Drive-Thru to the Front Counter. The simulation shows the single DT lane is a physical bottleneck that 4 staff cannot overcome; moving that labor to the Front Counter would better address the 'concert-goer' walk-in surge and likely bring the average wait time below the 300s threshold."
