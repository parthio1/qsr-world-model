        "reasoning": "### 1. Understand Operator Priority\nThe priority is 'Balanced', which requires a trade-off between maximizing revenue (by increasing throughput) and managing costs (staying within the 80-hour budget). \n\n### 2. Analyze Operational Scenario\n- **Demand:** Monday lunch on Peachtree St involves time-sensitive office workers. Sunny weather increases dine-in/walk-in preference (1.1 multiplier).\n- **Constraints:** Max budget is 80 hours. For an 8-hour shift, this limits us to 10 total staff members.\n\n### 3. Bottleneck Identification\n- **Primary Bottleneck:** The Kitchen. Previous data showed 5 staff members (112.5 orders/hr capacity) could not meet the 132 orders/hr peak demand, creating a 'ceiling' that caused cascading delays.\n- **Secondary Bottleneck:** Front Counter. With a 60% walk-in mix, 2 staff members were at 0.98 utilization, leading to high initial wait times.\n\n### 4. Reason Trade-offs\n- **Drive-Thru to Kitchen:** Previous data showed Drive-Thru was underutilized (0.48). By reducing Drive-Thru to the minimum of 2 staff, we free up 1 person. Moving this person to the Kitchen (total 6) increases kitchen capacity to ~135 orders/hr, which finally covers the 132 orders/hr peak.\n- **Front Counter vs. Kitchen:** While 2 staff at the Front Counter is tight (0.98 utilization), increasing the Kitchen's speed is more critical. If the kitchen is the bottleneck, adding more front-of-house staff only allows orders to be taken faster than they can be made, which increases the 'order-to-delivery' time and leads to customer abandonment.\n\n### 5. Risk Analysis\n- **Medium Risk:** The Front Counter will still experience high pressure during the 12:00-1:00 PM surge. There is a risk of visible lines forming at the counter; however, because the kitchen is now operating at a higher capacity, the total 'time-in-system' for customers will decrease, mitigating the 'Frustrating' wait time zone (315s+) seen previously.\n\n### 6. Staff Allocation & Cost\n- **Allocation:** 2 Drive-Thru, 6 Kitchen, 2 Front Counter (Total 10 staff).\n- **Cost Calculation:** 10 staff * 8 hours = 80 hours. At an estimated $15/hr, the cost is $1,200.00."

Dynamics: Total service capacity is 110/hr against a demand of 120/hr. This creates a deficit of 10 customers/hr. Over the 4-hour shift, approximately 32 customers are lost to abandonment (wait > 10 mins) or balking due to line length. 4. Financials: Revenue is calculated using a 50/50 split between DT ($16 AOV) and Walk-in ($20 AOV). Labor is fixed at $150/hr for 10 staff.

A raw score of 0.4 reflects the 'Frustrating' experience for urban office workers who prioritize speed.\n- **Staff Wellbeing:** A utilization of 0.94 is a 'Failure' state in this model (>0.90), resulting in a raw score of 0.2 due to the high probability of turnover and order errors.\n\n### 2. Trade-off Analysis\nThe 'Balanced' strategy failed to achieve balance in practice. While it solved the Kitchen bottleneck, it merely shifted the pressure to the Front Counter and Drive-Thru. The simulation shows that the system is 'red-lining.' The high revenue is a result of high demand, but the 32 lost customers (abandonment) represent a significant missed opportunity and long-term damage to customer loyalty.\n\n### 3. Alignment Justification\nUsing the Weighted Geometric Mean, the high Profit score (1.0) cannot compensate for the poor scores in Satisfaction (0.4) and Wellbeing (0.2). The formula `(1.0^0.4) * (0.4^0.35) * (0.2^0.25)` results in a combined score of 0.4847. This 'Poor' ranking is intentional; it signals that the current staffing plan is unsustainable and prioritizes short-term margins at the expense of operational health and customer retention."

This provides a strong foundation for the score but is heavily weighted (0.4). 2. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: This is the 'weak link' in the geometric mean. An average wait of 315s falls into the 300s-400s bracket (0.3-0.5). I assigned a 0.45 raw score because while the average is just over the limit, the peak wait of 11.5 minutes represents a significant service failure for an urban lunch crowd. 3. STAFF WELLBEING: The aggregate utilization of 0.82 is nearly perfect (0.95 raw score), though the simulation notes internal variance (burnout risk at Front Counter, idleness at DT). 4. MATHEMATICAL SYNTHESIS: Using the Weighted Geometric Mean [(0.98^0.4) * (0.45^0.35) * (0.95^0.25)], the high profit and wellbeing scores are 'pulled down' by the customer satisfaction deficit. The resulting 0.74 reflects a plan that is financially successful but operationally imbalanced, preventing an 'Excellent' or 'Very Good' ranking."

BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a capacity of 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: With a hard constraint of 80 budget hours (10 staff for an 8-hour shift), I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (2 above minimum) to maximize throughput. I allocated 2 to the front counter to manage the dine-in preference and 3 to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes. This prevents any one station from being the 'weak link' while staying within budget. RISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is that demand might still exceed the kitchen's physical capacity (80 orders/hr) regardless of staffing, leading to some wait times during the absolute peak of the lunch rush. However, staffing at 5 in the kitchen mitigates burnout and maintains quality. STAFF ALLOCATION: 3 Drive-thru, 5 Kitchen, 2 Front Counter.

Understand Operator Priority\nThe priority is 'Balanced', which requires a trade-off between maximizing revenue (by increasing throughput) and managing costs (staying within the 80-hour budget). \n\n### 2. Analyze Operational Scenario\n- **Demand:** Monday lunch on Peachtree St involves time-sensitive office workers. Sunny weather increases dine-in/walk-in preference (1.1 multiplier).\n- **Constraints:** Max budget is 80 hours. For an 8-hour shift, this limits us to 10 total staff members.\n\n### 3. Bottleneck Identification\n- **Primary Bottleneck:** The Kitchen. Previous data showed 5 staff members (112.5 orders/hr capacity) could not meet the 132 orders/hr peak demand, creating a 'ceiling' that caused cascading delays.\n- **Secondary Bottleneck:** Front Counter. With a 60% walk-in mix, 2 staff members were at 0.98 utilization, leading to high initial wait times.\n\n### 4. Reason Trade-offs\n- **Drive-Thru to Kitchen:** Previous data showed Drive-Thru was underutilized (0.48). By reducing Drive-Thru to the minimum of 2 staff, we free up 1 person. Moving this person to the Kitchen (total 6) increases kitchen capacity to ~135 orders/hr, which finally covers the 132 orders/hr peak.\n- **Front Counter vs. Kitchen:** While 2 staff at the Front Counter is tight (0.98 utilization), increasing the Kitchen's speed is more critical. If the kitchen is the bottleneck, adding more front-of-house staff only allows orders to be taken faster than they can be made, which increases the 'order-to-delivery' time and leads to customer abandonment.\n\n### 5. Risk Analysis\n- **Medium Risk:** The Front Counter will still experience high pressure during the 12:00-1:00 PM surge. There is a risk of visible lines forming at the counter; however, because the kitchen is now operating at a higher capacity, the total 'time-in-system' for customers will decrease, mitigating the 'Frustrating' wait time zone (315s+) seen previously.\n\n### 6. Staff Allocation & Cost\n- **Allocation:** 2 Drive-Thru, 6 Kitchen, 2 Front Counter (Total 10 staff).\n- **Cost Calculation:** 10 staff * 8 hours = 80 hours. At an estimated $15/hr, the cost is $1,200.00."
