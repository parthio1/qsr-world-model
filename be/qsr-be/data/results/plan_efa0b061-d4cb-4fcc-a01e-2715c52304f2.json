With a budget of 80 hours and an 8-hour shift, I am limited to 10 total staff members. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch in an office-heavy area (Peachtree St) with sunny weather suggests high dine-in preference (1.1 multiplier) and a need for speed. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the critical bottleneck, capped at 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 50% of the workforce (5 staff) to the kitchen to ensure it operates at its maximum capacity of 80 orders/hr. I allocated 3 staff to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes (1 order taker, 1 window, 1 bagger/runner) and 2 to the front counter to handle the increased dine-in traffic and lobby maintenance. This prevents the front-end from over-promising what the kitchen can deliver. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'medium' because even at max kitchen capacity, we cannot meet the theoretical 110 orders/hr demand. There is a risk of moderate wait times and kitchen staff stress during the peak 60 minutes of the lunch rush. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15/hr (estimated standard rate) = $1,200.00."

Queue Dynamics: During the peak hour, demand (160) exceeds kitchen capacity (112.5) by 47.5 orders. This creates a backlog where wait times hit the 10-minute (600s) abandonment limit, resulting in approximately 68 lost customers over the shift. 4. Financials: Revenue is calculated using a 60/40 split between Walk-in ($20 AOV) and Drive-thru ($16 AOV). Labor is fixed at $150/hr for 10 staff. Utilization is high (0.92) due to the sustained urban rush, which slightly degrades order accuracy to 0.89 due to high-stress levels in the kitchen."

Mathematically, while the Profit score is nearly perfect (0.98) due to a very low labor-to-revenue ratio of 7.9%, the plan fails in the other two critical dimensions. Customer Satisfaction received a raw score of 0.42 because the average wait time of 345s falls into the 'Frustrating' category, exacerbated by peak waits of 10 minutes. Staff Wellbeing received a raw score of 0.35 because a 92% utilization rate is unsustainable and indicates a high risk of burnout and error. Because the geometric mean penalizes imbalance, the high profit score cannot compensate for the poor performance in service and wellbeing. The resulting combined score of 0.5631 falls into the 'poor' ranking, indicating that this staffing level is too lean for the high-demand Peachtree St location during a sunny lunch rush."

With a budget of 80 hours and an 8-hour shift, I am limited to 10 total staff members. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch in an office-heavy area (Peachtree St) with sunny weather suggests high dine-in preference (1.1 multiplier) and a need for speed. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the critical bottleneck, capped at 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 50% of the workforce (5 staff) to the kitchen to ensure it operates at its maximum capacity of 80 orders/hr. I allocated 3 staff to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes (1 order taker, 1 window, 1 bagger/runner) and 2 to the front counter to handle the increased dine-in traffic and lobby maintenance. This prevents the front-end from over-promising what the kitchen can deliver. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'medium' because even at max kitchen capacity, we cannot meet the theoretical 110 orders/hr demand. There is a risk of moderate wait times and kitchen staff stress during the peak 60 minutes of the lunch rush. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter.

Staff Wellbeing received a raw score of 0.35 because a 92% utilization rate is unsustainable and indicates a high risk of burnout and error. Because the geometric mean penalizes imbalance, the high profit score cannot compensate for the poor performance in service and wellbeing. The resulting combined score of 0.5631 falls into the 'poor' ranking, indicating that this staffing level is too lean for the high-demand Peachtree St location during a sunny lunch rush."
