ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch in a high-pedestrian area (Peachtree St) implies a concentrated peak between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM. With a sunny forecast, we expect a standard distribution of customers across dine-in and drive-thru. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, with a capacity of 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (the highest allocation) to ensure the 'medium' capacity kitchen operates at its maximum efficiency of 80 orders/hr. To balance this, I've allocated 3 to the drive-thru (allowing for 2 lanes plus a runner/expeditor) and 2 to the front counter to manage the 50-seat dine-in area and pedestrian walk-ins. This prevents the front-of-house from over-promising what the kitchen cannot deliver. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is the 37.5% gap between peak demand and kitchen capacity. Even with optimal staffing, customers may experience wait times during the absolute peak. However, staffing at 10 total members (80 hours) ensures staff are not overwhelmed, maintaining wellbeing. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15/hr (estimated average) = $1,200.00."

Gap Analysis: Because demand (120) exceeds kitchen capacity (112.5), a queue naturally formed. Over a 4-hour window, the theoretical demand was 480, but the kitchen could only realistically process ~450. 4. Abandonment Logic: As peak wait times crossed the 10-minute threshold (600s), a 5-8% abandonment rate was applied to the overflow. 5.

To stay within the 80-hour budget (10 staff x 8 hours), I must keep Drive-Thru at the minimum of 2 and Front Counter at 2.

ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch in a high-pedestrian area (Peachtree St) implies a concentrated peak between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM. With a sunny forecast, we expect a standard distribution of customers across dine-in and drive-thru. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, with a capacity of 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (the highest allocation) to ensure the 'medium' capacity kitchen operates at its maximum efficiency of 80 orders/hr. To balance this, I've allocated 3 to the drive-thru (allowing for 2 lanes plus a runner/expeditor) and 2 to the front counter to manage the 50-seat dine-in area and pedestrian walk-ins. This prevents the front-of-house from over-promising what the kitchen cannot deliver. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is the 37.5% gap between peak demand and kitchen capacity. Even with optimal staffing, customers may experience wait times during the absolute peak. However, staffing at 10 total members (80 hours) ensures staff are not overwhelmed, maintaining wellbeing. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15/hr (estimated average) = $1,200.00."

Given the previous failure where wait times exceeded 10 minutes, the priority shifts toward stabilizing throughput without exceeding the 80-hour budget. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch on Peachtree St implies a time-sensitive professional crowd. The 120 orders/hr peak demand exceeds the previous kitchen capacity (112 orders/hr with 5 staff). BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck. Secondary bottleneck is the front counter's ability to manage dine-in cleaning and handoffs simultaneously. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 6 staff to the kitchen (up from 5) to break the production ceiling and prevent the 'persistent backlog' noted in feedback. To stay within the 80-hour budget (10 staff x 8 hours), I must keep Drive-Thru at the minimum of 2 and Front Counter at 2. While 2 at the front is lean, a faster kitchen reduces the 'order handoff' friction by ensuring food is ready when the customer reaches the counter, allowing front staff to focus more on lobby maintenance. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'Medium' because staff utilization remains high (near 0.85-0.90). There is a risk of front-of-house cleanliness issues if dine-in traffic is heavy, but this is a necessary trade-off to solve the primary driver of customer churn: excessive wait times.
