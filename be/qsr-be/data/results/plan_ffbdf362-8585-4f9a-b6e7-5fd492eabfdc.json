Since peak demand is 120, I have allocated 9 staff members to the kitchen to ensure it operates at 100% efficiency. For the service channels, I've assigned 5 to the drive-thru and 4 to the front counter to manage the 40/40/20 split of incoming guests. While we cannot meet the full peak demand of 120/hr due to physical infrastructure limits, this balanced allocation of 18 staff members (72 labor hours over a 4-hour window) stays within the 80-hour budget while maximizing our actual throughput potential."

This results in a maximum queue of 35 customers and a peak wait time of 25 minutes, causing approximately 15% of potential customers to abandon their orders during the peak hour. Revenue is maximized relative to the capacity ceiling, but efficiency is hampered by the throughput mismatch, leading to high staff stress and a slight dip in order accuracy."

I reallocated staff to the Front Counter (5) to handle the combined 60% demand from Dine-in and Delivery, directly addressing the feedback regarding urban delivery driver wait times. Drive-thru is staffed at 5, which is sufficient for its 40% demand share (48 orders/hr peak demand, but capped at ~32 orders/hr by kitchen output). Total staffing is reduced to 18 to optimize labor costs, as the additional 2 staff in the previous plan were unable to increase revenue due to the hard kitchen bottleneck.

This results in a total of 312 customers served out of 360 demanded. The average wait time is elevated to 9 minutes, and peak wait times reach 12.5 minutes, triggering abandonment.

            "reasoning": "The previous plan failed because it overstaffed the service points (Drive-Thru and Front Counter) relative to what the kitchen could actually produce, leading to idle staff and a massive backlog. With a hard kitchen ceiling of 80 orders/hr and a peak demand of 120 orders/hr, the priority must be kitchen output. I have increased kitchen staffing to 13 to ensure no internal kitchen delays occur and to push the throughput ceiling as high as possible. I reduced Drive-Thru to 4 and Front Counter to 3; even at these levels, they can handle the 80 orders/hr the kitchen provides (approx 32 for DT and 48 for FC/Delivery). This rebalancing directly addresses the 'idle service staff' feedback and aims to lower the 540s wait time by ensuring the kitchen never falls below its 80/hr peak, while accepting that some abandonment is inevitable until the kitchen capacity itself is upgraded."
