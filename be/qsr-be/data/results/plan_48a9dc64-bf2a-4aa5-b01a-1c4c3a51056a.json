By increasing kitchen staff to 6, we raise the throughput capacity to approximately 138 orders/hour, which successfully covers the 135 orders/hour peak demand and reduces staff utilization below the 92% burnout threshold. We allocate 3 staff to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes and order-taking surges, while maintaining the front counter at the minimum requirement of 1. This trade-off ensures that the primary volume drivers (Kitchen and Drive-Thru) are stabilized to prevent the 10-minute wait times previously observed, even if the front counter remains lean during the corporate lunch rush."

Weaknesses: Critical staff burnout risk with utilization at 92%, exceeding the 90% threshold for sustainable operations., Significant kitchen bottleneck during peak hours (135 orders/hr demand vs 115 capacity) leading to customer churn., Peak wait times reached 640 seconds (over 10 minutes), resulting in observed drive-thru abandonment.. Please adjust staffing to address these specific issues."
