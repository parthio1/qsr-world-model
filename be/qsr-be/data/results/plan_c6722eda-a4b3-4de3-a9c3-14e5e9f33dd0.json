      "strengths": [
        "Excellent labor-to-revenue ratio (9.3%)",
        "High total revenue generation ($7,776.00)",
        "Strong order accuracy (94%) despite high pressure",
        "Maximum utilization of available kitchen staff"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Average wait time (385s) exceeds the 300s problematic threshold",
        "Kitchen capacity (135 orders/hr) is a hard bottleneck against peak demand (155 orders/hr)",
        "Staff utilization (0.89) is bordering on burnout levels, leading to reported high stress"
      ],
      "recommendation": "While the staffing level is high, the physical kitchen capacity is the primary constraint. To improve scores, consider optimizing kitchen workflows or equipment to increase throughput beyond 135 orders/hr. Additionally, implementing a 'line-busting' strategy in the drive-thru could help manage the 18-car queue spillover, though the kitchen must be able to handle the resulting speed."
