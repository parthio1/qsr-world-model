ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A sunny Monday lunch on Peachtree St implies high business-professional traffic. With a 1.1x preference for drive-thru and a 1.0 for dine-in, both channels will be active. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, capped at 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (50% of the total shift) to ensure the 'medium' capacity kitchen can actually hit its 80 orders/hr ceiling. 3 staff are assigned to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes (one for ordering, one for payment, one for window/running), and 2 are assigned to the front counter to handle dine-in and lobby management. This prevents the front-of-house from becoming a secondary bottleneck. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'medium' because even with optimal staffing, the physical infrastructure of the kitchen (80 orders/hr) cannot meet the peak theoretical demand (110 orders/hr). Staff will be under high pressure during the 12 PM - 1 PM window, but this allocation provides the best support to mitigate burnout. STAFF ALLOCATION: 3 DT, 5 Kitchen, 2 FC. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15/hr (estimated) = $1,200.0."

Queue Dynamics: Because demand (120) slightly exceeded kitchen capacity (112.5), a queue formed during the peak 90 minutes. Peak wait times approached 9.3 minutes, nearing the 10-minute abandonment threshold, resulting in a loss of approximately 4% of potential customers. 4.

REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 6 staff to the kitchen to ensure speed and accuracy, and 3 to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes effectively. This leaves the front counter at the minimum (1 staff). The trade-off is that walk-in customers may experience longer queues at the register, but this protects the higher-volume drive-thru and ensures the kitchen doesn't collapse under pressure.

BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck, capped at 80 orders/hr against a potential demand of 110 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (50% of the total shift) to ensure the 'medium' capacity kitchen can actually hit its 80 orders/hr ceiling. 3 staff are assigned to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes (one for ordering, one for payment, one for window/running), and 2 are assigned to the front counter to handle dine-in and lobby management. This prevents the front-of-house from becoming a secondary bottleneck. RISK ANALYSIS: The risk is 'medium' because even with optimal staffing, the physical infrastructure of the kitchen (80 orders/hr) cannot meet the peak theoretical demand (110 orders/hr). Staff will be under high pressure during the 12 PM - 1 PM window, but this allocation provides the best support to mitigate burnout. STAFF ALLOCATION: 3 DT, 5 Kitchen, 2 FC.

Given previous feedback of 98% staff utilization and declining accuracy, the priority here is to stabilize the operation by using the full 80-hour budget (10 staff members) to prevent burnout and improve customer experience. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday lunch on Peachtree St implies high-volume professional traffic. With a demand of ~120 orders/hr and a kitchen cap of 80, we must ensure the kitchen operates at 100% of its potential efficiency. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck. Even with optimal staffing, the physical 'medium' capacity (80 orders/hr) cannot meet the 120 orders/hr demand. However, staffing it with 6 people allows for a dedicated 'Expeditor/QC' role to fix the accuracy issues (0.91) noted previously. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 6 staff to the kitchen to ensure speed and accuracy, and 3 to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes effectively. This leaves the front counter at the minimum (1 staff). The trade-off is that walk-in customers may experience longer queues at the register, but this protects the higher-volume drive-thru and ensures the kitchen doesn't collapse under pressure. RISK ANALYSIS: The 'Medium' risk level reflects the fact that the kitchen remains a physical bottleneck; even with 6 staff, we will likely have a backlog during the 12:00 PM peak. There is also a risk of front-counter congestion, but this is secondary to maintaining the flow of the drive-thru and kitchen production."
