BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a capacity of 80/hr; if orders from both the 2-lane drive-thru and the 50-seat dine-in area peak simultaneously, the kitchen will fail first. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (2 above minimum) to ensure food production keeps pace with demand. I've added 1 extra staff to the front counter (total 2) to manage the 'sunny weather' foot traffic and dine-in cleaning. The drive-thru gets 3 staff to manage two lanes and a window efficiently.

The previous plan's 0.94 utilization was a failure point for wellbeing.\n\nANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Lunch peak on Peachtree St involves high-volume office traffic. Peak demand hits 135 orders/hr. With a budget of 80 hours and standard 8-hour shifts, I have exactly 10 staff members to deploy.\n\nBOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The primary bottleneck is the Kitchen. Previous data shows 5 staff capped at 115 orders/hr, causing an 8% abandonment rate. The secondary bottleneck is the Drive-Thru merge point during peak flow.\n\nREASON TRADE-OFFS: I am allocating 6 staff to the Kitchen (up from 5) to ensure production exceeds peak demand (135/hr). To afford this within the 10-person limit, I must keep the Front Counter at 1 person. While Peachtree St has high foot traffic, a kitchen backlog delays all channels; therefore, kitchen throughput is the priority. For the Drive-Thru, I am maintaining 3 staff but re-tasking one as a 'Merge Coordinator/Line Buster' (feasible in sunny weather) to address the physical lane merge slowdown mentioned in feedback.\n\nRISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is 'Medium' due to the Front Counter having only 1 staff member. During an office rush, walk-in lines may grow. However, because the kitchen is now optimized, the 'Total Time' (order to hand-off) will decrease, mitigating the frustration of a long ordering line. Staff burnout risk is significantly lowered as the per-person load in the kitchen drops by ~17%.\n\nSTAFF ALLOCATION: 6 Kitchen (Production), 3 Drive-Thru (1 Window, 1 Bagger, 1 Merge/Line Buster), 1 Front Counter (Order Entry/Dine-in Support).\n\nESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 staff * 8 hours * $15.00/hr (standardized rate) = $1200.0."

Staff Wellbeing is also high (0.95) as the 0.82 utilization avoids the 'burnout zone' (>0.90). However, Customer Satisfaction is a 'Poor' outlier (0.42) due to the 345s average wait time and high abandonment. 2. GEOMETRIC MEAN IMPACT: Using the weighted geometric mean, the low Customer Satisfaction score (0.42 raised to 0.35) acts as a significant drag on the total. While the linear average would be ~0.78, the geometric mean pulls the final score down to 0.72. 3. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS: The 'Balanced' strategy failed to account for the Peachtree St urban context, which favors walk-ins. By over-prioritizing Drive-Thru efficiency, the plan sacrificed roughly $1,600 in potential walk-in revenue (82 lost customers * $20 avg). 4.

Demand is estimated at 120+ total orders/hr (72 walk-in, 48 drive-thru). BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The Front Counter was the previous bottleneck. However, with 3 staff now at the counter, the bottleneck shifts to the Kitchen, which has a rated capacity of 80 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I reduced Drive-Thru staffing from 3 to 2 because 48 cars/hr does not justify a third person, especially when the Front Counter is losing 80+ customers. I increased Kitchen staff to 5 (the upper limit for 'medium' capacity) to ensure the kitchen can get as close to its 80 orders/hr ceiling as possible. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'Medium' because total demand (120) still exceeds kitchen capacity (80). Customers will still experience waits during the peak 12-1 PM window, but abandonment will be significantly lower than the previous plan because the order-taking bottleneck at the Front Counter is resolved.

While the linear average would be ~0.78, the geometric mean pulls the final score down to 0.72. 3. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS: The 'Balanced' strategy failed to account for the Peachtree St urban context, which favors walk-ins. By over-prioritizing Drive-Thru efficiency, the plan sacrificed roughly $1,600 in potential walk-in revenue (82 lost customers * $20 avg). 4.

However, Customer Satisfaction is a 'Poor' outlier (0.42) due to the 345s average wait time and high abandonment. 2. GEOMETRIC MEAN IMPACT: Using the weighted geometric mean, the low Customer Satisfaction score (0.42 raised to 0.35) acts as a significant drag on the total. While the linear average would be ~0.78, the geometric mean pulls the final score down to 0.72. 3. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS: The 'Balanced' strategy failed to account for the Peachtree St urban context, which favors walk-ins. By over-prioritizing Drive-Thru efficiency, the plan sacrificed roughly $1,600 in potential walk-in revenue (82 lost customers * $20 avg). 4.

            "reasoning": "UNDERSTAND OPERATOR PRIORITY: The 'Balanced' priority requires a trade-off between labor efficiency and customer experience. The goal is to prevent the massive customer abandonment seen previously while maintaining a sustainable labor cost. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Monday lunch on Peachtree St with sunny weather creates a 'perfect storm' for walk-in traffic from nearby offices. Demand is estimated at 120+ total orders/hr (72 walk-in, 48 drive-thru). BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The Front Counter was the previous bottleneck. However, with 3 staff now at the counter, the bottleneck shifts to the Kitchen, which has a rated capacity of 80 orders/hr. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I reduced Drive-Thru staffing from 3 to 2 because 48 cars/hr does not justify a third person, especially when the Front Counter is losing 80+ customers. I increased Kitchen staff to 5 (the upper limit for 'medium' capacity) to ensure the kitchen can get as close to its 80 orders/hr ceiling as possible. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'Medium' because total demand (120) still exceeds kitchen capacity (80). Customers will still experience waits during the peak 12-1 PM window, but abandonment will be significantly lower than the previous plan because the order-taking bottleneck at the Front Counter is resolved. STAFF ALLOCATION: 3 Front Counter (2 registers, 1 runner), 2 Drive-Thru (1 order/pay, 1 bag/handout), 5 Kitchen (Line, Prep, Grill). ESTIMATED LABOR COST: 10 total staff * 8 hours * $15/hr average = $1,200."

However, the kitchen capacity (5 staff * 22.5 orders/hr = 112.5/hr) acted as the primary constraint. During the 90-minute peak, demand exceeded kitchen capacity by ~20%, leading to a queue buildup. Applying the abandonment logic, approximately 38 customers were lost due to wait times exceeding the 10-minute threshold. Revenue was calculated using a 50/50 split between Drive-Thru ($16 AOV) and Front Counter ($20 AOV). Labor cost is fixed at $150/hr for the 10-person crew.
