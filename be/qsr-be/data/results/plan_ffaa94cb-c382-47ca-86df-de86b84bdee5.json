This allocation respects the physical constraints of the 2-lane drive-thru (2 staff) and the urban dine-in preference (2 staff), while concentrating 5 staff in the kitchen to address the 80-guest-per-hour capacity bottleneck. This reduction lowers the estimated labor cost to approximately 23.5% of projected revenue (based on previous feedback), significantly improving profitability and staff utilization while still providing enough coverage to manage the 120-guest peak as effectively as the kitchen bottleneck allows."

            "reasoning": "While the plan achieves excellent customer service metrics, it fails commercially. The labor cost is 21.4% over target, resulting in a 0.0 profit score. Similarly, staff utilization is 56 points below the ideal 0.82, indicating that the restaurant is paying for significant idle capacity. The trade-off for speed has resulted in a critical failure of operational efficiency."

Issues: Average wait time of 465s is 285s over target, leading to a 0.0 score, Staff utilization of 0.92 exceeds the ideal 0.82, indicating high stress and potential for errors, Kitchen throughput bottleneck resulted in significant customer abandonment during peak. Address these issues to improve alignment with objectives."
