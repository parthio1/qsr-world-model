            "recommendation": "Consider reducing the headcount by 1 staff member to increase utilization closer to the 0.82 target while maintaining service speed.",
            "reasoning": "The staffing plan is highly effective for financial and customer service goals, achieving a 1.0 score in both. However, the staff wellbeing score is lower (0.4667) because the actual utilization (0.74) deviates from the ideal target (0.82), suggesting the team is slightly under-leveraged."

Bottlenecks found: Front counter staffing (1 person) insufficient for downtown walk-in volume, Drive-thru physical lane capacity reached during peak Friday rush. Issues: Average wait time (415s) is nearly 4 minutes over the target, Severe bottleneck at front counter due to single-person staffing, 15% customer abandonment rate during peak hours. Address these issues to improve alignment with objectives."
