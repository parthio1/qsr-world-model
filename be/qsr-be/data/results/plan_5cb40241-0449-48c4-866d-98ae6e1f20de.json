      "weaknesses": [
        "Kitchen capacity bottleneck (112 orders/hr capacity vs 118 demand) caused peak wait times to exceed 6 minutes",
        "Customer abandonments (3) due to peak congestion",
        "Imbalanced utilization between Drive-Thru (0.65) and Kitchen (1.0 during peak)",
        "Average wait time (295s) is dangerously close to the 300s problematic threshold"
      ],
      "recommendation": "Reallocate one staff member from the Drive-Thru to the Kitchen during the 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM peak. The Drive-Thru is currently overstaffed (utilization 0.65), while the kitchen is the primary bottleneck. Cross-training this individual would resolve the 118 orders/hour demand spike, eliminate abandonments, and bring the average wait time well below the 300s threshold."
