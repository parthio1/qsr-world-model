To meet the 'balanced' priority on a sunny Sunday at a high-traffic location like Peachtree St, we allocate the maximum allowed staff. The kitchen is the primary bottleneck for a 2-lane drive-thru and a 50-seat dine-in area, so 5 staff are assigned there to ensure speed of service. 3 staff members in the drive-thru allow for efficient management of both lanes and the payment window. 2 staff members at the front counter ensure that dine-in customers are served promptly while maintaining lobby cleanliness, which is crucial for the Sunday lunch crowd. This distribution balances labor costs with the need for high-quality customer experience and prevents staff burnout by avoiding skeleton crews during a peak period."
