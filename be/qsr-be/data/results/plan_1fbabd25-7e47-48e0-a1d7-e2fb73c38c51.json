The previous attempt showed that 5 kitchen staff created a hard bottleneck and high burnout risk (0.89 utilization). ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday lunch on Peachtree St with sunny weather suggests high professional walk-in and drive-thru traffic. The 12:00-1:00 PM peak is the critical window. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck; if it cannot produce 140 orders/hour, wait times will spiral regardless of front-end staffing. The drive-thru hand-off is a secondary bottleneck. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am moving 1 staff member from the front counter (reducing it to the minimum of 1) to the kitchen. While this increases the risk of walk-in wait times, it is necessary to solve the production cap that affects all channels. 6 kitchen staff allows for a throughput of ~150 orders/hour, clearing the 140-order peak. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'Medium' due to the front counter being under-staffed for a 50-seat dine-in area with a 1.05 preference multiplier. Customers may experience longer queues at the counter, but the overall speed of service will improve as the kitchen will no longer have a backlog.

The goal is to meet the 80-hour budget while maintaining service standards. ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday lunch shift in a professional area (Peachtree St) with sunny weather suggests a high volume of time-sensitive customers. The 1.05 multiplier for dine-in due to weather means the front counter will be busier than usual. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the critical bottleneck with a capacity of 80 against a potential demand of 100. If the kitchen fails, both the drive-thru and front counter wait times will skyrocket. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (well above the minimum of 3) to maximize throughput. We moved 1 extra staff member to the front counter (total 2) to handle the sunny-day dine-in surge, and 3 to the drive-thru to manage the two lanes effectively. This prevents staff burnout during the 12 PM - 1 PM peak. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is 'low.' While we are at the budget limit, the kitchen might still struggle if demand hits the absolute maximum (100), but 5 staff members provide the best possible defense within the 80-hour constraint. STAFF ALLOCATION: 3 DT, 5 Kitchen, 2 Front. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at a standard $15/hr rate (80 hours * $15 = $1,200)."

ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday lunch on Peachtree St with sunny weather suggests high professional walk-in and drive-thru traffic. The 12:00-1:00 PM peak is the critical window.

The drive-thru hand-off is a secondary bottleneck. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am moving 1 staff member from the front counter (reducing it to the minimum of 1) to the kitchen. While this increases the risk of walk-in wait times, it is necessary to solve the production cap that affects all channels. 6 kitchen staff allows for a throughput of ~150 orders/hour, clearing the 140-order peak.
