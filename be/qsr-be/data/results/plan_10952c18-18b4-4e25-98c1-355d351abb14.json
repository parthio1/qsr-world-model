I have allocated 6 staff to the kitchen to prevent it from falling below its 80/hr limit. With 2 drive-thru lanes and high dine-in expectations due to the sunny Friday weather in downtown Atlanta, 4 staff are assigned to the drive-thru and 3 to the front counter. This balanced approach uses 13 of the 15 available staff, providing a buffer for the rush while acknowledging that we cannot meet the full 156/hr demand due to physical infrastructure constraints. The risk is medium because demand significantly exceeds capacity, which will likely lead to long wait times regardless of staffing levels."

Increasing Drive-Thru staff to 4 (2 per lane) addresses the 15% abandonment rate by speeding up the payment and hand-out process, preventing internal delays from further restricting the 60/hr lane capacity. Total staff is set at 12 to bring the utilization rate closer to the 0.82 target, balancing labor costs with staff wellbeing and service quality.

              "Average wait time (320s) is nearly double the target (180s), leading to significant customer abandonment.",
              "Staff utilization (0.88) remains above the sustainable target of 0.82, indicating high risk of burnout.",
              "Physical infrastructure (kitchen capacity) is a hard bottleneck that staffing cannot resolve."
            ],
            "recommendation": "Since the kitchen's physical capacity (80 orders/hr) is the primary constraint, additional staffing will not improve wait times. Implement mobile order throttling or invest in high-speed kitchen equipment to align throughput with the 156/hr peak demand.",
            "reasoning": "The plan achieves profit targets but fails critically on customer satisfaction due to wait times exceeding the target by 140 seconds, resulting in a 0.0 score for that metric. Staff wellbeing is also compromised by high utilization (0.88). The 'fair' ranking reflects a plan that is financially sound but operationally overwhelmed by infrastructure limits."

      "feedback": "Current Plan Score: 0.533. Bottlenecks found: Kitchen physical infrastructure (80 orders/hr limit) prevents staff from meeting peak demand of 156/hr., Drive-thru lane capacity restricts throughput despite adequate staffing levels.. Issues: Critical failure in wait time targets (415s vs 180s), High customer abandonment (15%) due to drive-thru queue overflow, Staff utilization (0.88) exceeds the ideal 0.82 threshold, increasing burnout risk. Address these issues to improve alignment with objectives."
