ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Peachtree St is a business district, meaning a concentrated burst of orders between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM. Sunny weather increases dine-in preference (1.1 multiplier), making the front counter a critical touchpoint. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a strict 80 orders/hr limit. If the kitchen is understaffed, the 110-order capacity of the FOH will cause a massive backlog. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (50% of the shift) to ensure maximum throughput. I allocated 3 to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes efficiently (one order taker, one window, one runner/bagger). The front counter receives 2 staff to handle the increased dine-in traffic and lobby management. This uses exactly 10 staff members (10 staff * 8 hours = 80 budget hours). RISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is 'medium' kitchen capacity; even with 5 staff, a sudden surge beyond the 1.0 demand multiplier could lead to increased wait times. However, this is the most stable configuration within the 80-hour budget constraint. STAFF ALLOCATION: Drive-thru: 3, Kitchen: 5, Front Counter: 2. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at an average of $15/hr for 80 hours."

Over a 4-hour shift, this creates a total potential demand of 480 customers. However, capacity constraints were identified in the kitchen. With 5 kitchen staff (capacity ~112.5 orders/hr), the kitchen became a bottleneck during the 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM peak where demand surged to 140+ orders/hr. This resulted in approximately 42 customers abandoning the queue (8.7% abandonment rate) as wait times approached the 10-minute threshold. Revenue was calculated using a 60/40 split between Drive-Thru ($16 AOV) and Walk-in ($20 AOV), reflecting the high urban foot traffic. Staff utilization is high (0.91), which explains the slight dip in order accuracy (0.94) due to high-pressure environment during the peak hour."

Using linear interpolation within the 0.6-0.8 scoring bracket, 245s yields a raw score of 0.70. However, the peak wait of 510s suggests a volatile experience. 3. ANALYZE STAFF WELLBEING: Utilization is 0.91. The criteria explicitly marks >0.90 as 'Burnout/High Risk' (0.0-0.4). I have assigned a 0.35 to reflect that while the team didn't collapse, they operated at an unsustainable 'redline' pace. 4.

The geometric mean correctly penalizes the plan because the high profit was achieved by 'burning' the staff and allowing the kitchen to bottleneck, preventing a 'Good' or 'Excellent' balanced outcome."

ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: Peachtree St is a business district, meaning a concentrated burst of orders between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM. Sunny weather increases dine-in preference (1.1 multiplier), making the front counter a critical touchpoint. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a strict 80 orders/hr limit. If the kitchen is understaffed, the 110-order capacity of the FOH will cause a massive backlog. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff to the kitchen (50% of the shift) to ensure maximum throughput. I allocated 3 to the drive-thru to manage the dual lanes efficiently (one order taker, one window, one runner/bagger). The front counter receives 2 staff to handle the increased dine-in traffic and lobby management. This uses exactly 10 staff members (10 staff * 8 hours = 80 budget hours). RISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is 'medium' kitchen capacity; even with 5 staff, a sudden surge beyond the 1.0 demand multiplier could lead to increased wait times. However, this is the most stable configuration within the 80-hour budget constraint. STAFF ALLOCATION: Drive-thru: 3, Kitchen: 5, Front Counter: 2.

With 5 kitchen staff (capacity ~112.5 orders/hr), the kitchen became a bottleneck during the 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM peak where demand surged to 140+ orders/hr.
