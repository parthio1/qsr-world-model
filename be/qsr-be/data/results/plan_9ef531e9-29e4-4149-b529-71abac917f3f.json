BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: Previous data shows the kitchen (at 5 staff) maxed at 112 orders/hour, causing a 10-minute wait time. The kitchen is the definitive bottleneck. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am increasing kitchen staff to 6 (the maximum feasible within budget) to push throughput closer to 140 orders/hour. To afford this, the front counter is kept at the minimum (1), as drive-thru typically accounts for higher volume in this QSR profile. Drive-thru is set to 3 to ensure that two lanes are managed and a dedicated runner/bagger can prevent the 'idling' issue noted in the feedback. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is front-counter congestion if dine-in demand spikes unexpectedly; however, a functioning kitchen reduces the duration of that congestion.

While the Drive-Thru capacity (90/hr) comfortably handled its 72/hr load, the Front Counter (40/hr capacity) failed to meet the 48/hr demand. This created a persistent queue where wait times hit the 10-minute abandonment threshold, resulting in approximately 32 lost customers. Kitchen capacity (135/hr) was sufficient to handle the throughput of 112 orders/hr, but the high utilization (0.83-0.92 during peak) suggests a high-stress environment. Revenue was calculated using the $16 DT and $20 Walk-in AOV. Labor cost is fixed at $150/hr for 10 staff."

Mathematically, the plan achieved an elite Profit score (0.98) due to the extremely low labor ratio of 7.68%. ANALYZE TRADE-OFFS: However, this profit was gained by under-staffing the front counter. The Customer Satisfaction raw score (0.70) reflects an average wait of 245s, but the geometric mean penalizes the plan because this 'average' masks a total failure at the front counter where wait times hit 10 minutes (abandonment threshold). STAFFING IMPACT: Staff wellbeing (0.70) is in the sub-optimal range; while 0.88 utilization is productive, the simulation's 'key events' highlight high-stress spikes that threaten long-term retention. FINAL ALIGNMENT: The Weighted Geometric Mean results in a 0.8007. While the linear average would be higher (~0.79), the geometric formula correctly identifies that the 'Excellent' profit score cannot fully compensate for the 'Fair/Tolerable' performance in customer service and staff stress, resulting in a 'Very Good' rather than 'Excellent' ranking."

Sunny weather suggests steady traffic in both the 2-lane drive-thru and the 50-seat dine-in area. \n\nBOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck with a capacity of 80 orders/hr, whereas the combined front-of-house demand potential is 110. If the kitchen is understaffed, the entire operation fails regardless of how many people are at the windows. \n\nREASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated 5 staff members to the kitchen (the highest allocation) to ensure the bottleneck operates at its maximum 80 orders/hr capacity. I allocated 3 to the drive-thru (1 above minimum) to manage the two lanes effectively, and 2 to the front counter to handle the 50-seat dine-in capacity. This uses exactly 10 staff members (10 staff * 8 hours = 80 budget hours). \n\nRISK ANALYSIS: The risk is low. The main risk is that if demand exceeds the 1.0 multiplier, the kitchen will still be the ceiling, but with 5 staff, we are maximizing its output. Staff wellbeing is protected by not running a 'lean' crew during a peak lunch window. \n\nESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at an industry average of $15/hr * 80 total hours = $1,200."

REASON TRADE-OFFS: I am increasing kitchen staff to 6 (the maximum feasible within budget) to push throughput closer to 140 orders/hour. To afford this, the front counter is kept at the minimum (1), as drive-thru typically accounts for higher volume in this QSR profile. Drive-thru is set to 3 to ensure that two lanes are managed and a dedicated runner/bagger can prevent the 'idling' issue noted in the feedback.
