ANALYZE OPERATIONAL SCENARIO: A Monday dinner shift with a demand of 85 orders/hr exceeds the kitchen's 80 orders/hr capacity. With a budget of 80 hours and an 8-hour shift duration, we are capped at 10 total staff members. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck. If the kitchen falls behind on complex dinner orders, both the drive-thru and front counter experience increased wait times. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We allocate 50% of the workforce (5 staff) to the kitchen to maximize throughput and manage ticket complexity. The drive-thru receives 3 staff to manage the dual lanes (one for window/payment, one for bagging, one for order-taking/expediting). The front counter is assigned 2 staff to handle both dine-in guests and the delivery channel. RISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is a slight increase in wait times if demand hits the theoretical 85 orders/hr maximum, as the kitchen remains the hard limit. However, this allocation minimizes staff burnout by providing maximum support to the busiest station. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter. ESTIMATED LABOR COST: Calculated at an industry average of $15/hr (80 total hours * $15 = $1,200)."

Capacity Analysis: With 5 kitchen staff, the production ceiling is 112.5 orders/hour. The 3 drive-thru staff across 2 lanes provide a service ceiling of 90 cars/hour. 3. Queue Dynamics: During the 6:00 PM peak, demand (105/hr) approached kitchen capacity (112.5/hr), pushing utilization to 0.93. This created a temporary queue but stayed well below the 10-minute abandonment threshold. 4. Financials: Revenue was calculated using a 65/35 split between Drive-Thru ($16 AOV) and Walk-in ($20 AOV). Labor was fixed at $150/hr for the 10-person crew. The result is a highly efficient shift with a healthy 0.74 utilization rate, representing the 'sweet spot' for QSR operations."

With a budget of 80 hours and an 8-hour shift duration, we are capped at 10 total staff members. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: The kitchen is the primary bottleneck. If the kitchen falls behind on complex dinner orders, both the drive-thru and front counter experience increased wait times. REASON TRADE-OFFS: We allocate 50% of the workforce (5 staff) to the kitchen to maximize throughput and manage ticket complexity. The drive-thru receives 3 staff to manage the dual lanes (one for window/payment, one for bagging, one for order-taking/expediting). The front counter is assigned 2 staff to handle both dine-in guests and the delivery channel. RISK ANALYSIS: The main risk is a slight increase in wait times if demand hits the theoretical 85 orders/hr maximum, as the kitchen remains the hard limit. However, this allocation minimizes staff burnout by providing maximum support to the busiest station. STAFF ALLOCATION: 5 Kitchen, 3 Drive-Thru, 2 Front Counter.

Queue Dynamics: During the 6:00 PM peak, demand (105/hr) approached kitchen capacity (112.5/hr), pushing utilization to 0.93.

Total demand (85 orders/hr) slightly exceeds theoretical kitchen capacity (80 orders/hr), necessitating maximum efficiency in the back-of-house. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION: Feedback from the previous attempt explicitly identified the kitchen assembly station as the failure point during the 6:15 PM - 7:15 PM surge, leading to 'Tolerable' rather than 'Excellent' wait times. REASON TRADE-OFFS: I have allocated the maximum allowable staff (10 people for an 8-hour shift = 80 hours) to ensure the kitchen is fully bolstered. I am keeping the front counter at the minimum (1) because the dine-in capacity is small (25 seats) and Monday demand is typically drive-thru heavy. The third person in the drive-thru is essential to manage the dual lanes and ensure the window doesn't become a secondary bottleneck once the kitchen speeds up. RISK ANALYSIS: The primary risk is a sudden surge in dine-in customers which would overwhelm the single front-counter staff member. However, given the 'Balanced' priority and the known kitchen bottleneck, this is a calculated trade-off to prioritize the highest volume channel (Drive-Thru) and overall order completion speed.
